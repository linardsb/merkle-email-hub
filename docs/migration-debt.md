# Migration Safety Debt

## Squawk pre-commit hook stays advisory (`|| true` retained)

`.pre-commit-config.yaml:93` runs Squawk against staged migration files but
swallows the exit code:

```yaml
entry: bash -c 'command -v squawk >/dev/null 2>&1 && git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep "alembic/versions/.*\.py$" | xargs -I{} squawk --reporter=compact {} || true'
```

### Why it stays advisory in Phase 1b

- **Squawk is not part of the dev-environment baseline.** It is not in
  `pyproject.toml`, not auto-installed by `make install-hooks`, and not
  documented in any developer setup path. Removing `|| true` would silently
  hard-fail commits on every contributor who never installed Squawk.
- **Pre-flight verification of an ignore mechanism (Phase 1b §1.5 Step 6)
  was not feasible** because Squawk was unavailable on the planning machine.
  Without proof that `--exclude-rule` / `.squawk.toml` works reliably, we
  cannot promote it to a hard gate without risk of a 44-migration history
  triggering rules on already-shipped DDL.
- **CI already enforces Squawk** at `.github/workflows/ci.yml:117-139` via
  the `migration-lint` job, scoped to `pull_request` events and to the diff
  vs. base branch. Hard enforcement happens there, where the runner is
  guaranteed to have Squawk installed.

The local hook is a quality-of-life nudge (catches issues before the dev
pushes), not a safety gate. The CI job is the safety gate.

### What unblocks promoting it to a hard gate

1. Add Squawk install to `make install-hooks` (or a shared `make bootstrap`
   target) so every dev has it.
2. Capture the current diff of `squawk --reporter=compact alembic/versions/*.py`
   against the existing migrations. If any rules fire on shipped migrations,
   create a `.squawk.toml` at repo root with `--exclude-rule` entries
   (one per rule) until the historical diff is clean.
3. Replace the `|| true` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml:93` with explicit error
   propagation: `... | xargs -I{} squawk --reporter=compact {}` (no trailing
   `|| true`). Commit the `.squawk.toml` in the same PR.

This unblock is Phase 2 (audit §2.4 `alembic check` work) territory — the
migration-lint job will get hardened alongside the new `alembic check` gate.

## Other migration-related deferrals

None at present. `alembic upgrade head` against a fresh DB is exercised in
the e2e-smoke job; promoting it to a standalone gate is Phase 2 §2.4.
