# pyright: reportUnknownMemberType=false
"""Tenant-scoped database session dependency.

`get_scoped_db` resolves the authenticated user, computes their accessible
project and organization sets from `ProjectMember`, and stamps both on
`session.info`. Repository methods read those sets via :func:`scoped_access`
and apply `WHERE project_id IN (...)` / `WHERE client_org_id IN (...)` filters
on every list/get/update/delete.

Admin role bypasses scoping by stamping ``None`` for both sets — repositories
treat ``None`` as "no filter" (admins get cross-tenant reads, by design).

Routes that genuinely need cross-tenant access without a user (login flow,
``/health``, the ``get_current_user`` resolver itself) keep the unscoped
``get_db`` — see the allowlist in
``.agents/plans/tech-debt-03-multi-tenant-isolation.md`` §A3.
